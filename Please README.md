I belive I did most thing requried for the GUI. The one thing I cound't do was add images. 
I did a lot of research and reading the book but I couldn't get it to work. 
My issue was not finding the file, I put png files every on my computer but visual studio code 
could not find it. I did so much research to find an answer to my problem but none worked. 
That is the reason why my code doesn't have images in it.
